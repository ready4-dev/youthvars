Description: Classes that describe the structural properties of variables
    commonly present in youth mental health datasets and some (where
    freely available) related scoring algorithms.  The main motivation for
    this package is to enable data integrity tools that ensure that
    methods are applied to the appropriate data structures.  This
    development version of the youthvars package has been made available
    as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. The
    tools contained in this development release automate a number of tasks
    which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  Therefore
    you should only trial this software if you feel confident that you
    understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in which you
    can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions, please
    contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).  The
    documentation for this package has been automatically generated by the
    ready4fun package and is therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored
    documentation will follow in 2021.

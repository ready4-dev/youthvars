Description: Tools to describe, summarise and score types of data commonly
    present in youth mental health collections.  The main motivation for
    this package is to facilitate automated data integrity checks, ensure
    that methods are applied to the appropriate data structures and
    streamline reporting of descriptive statistics.  This development
    version of the youthvars package has been made available as part of
    the process of testing and documenting the package. The documentation
    for this package has been automatically generated by the ready4fun
    package and is therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored
    documentation will follow in 2021.  If you have any questions, please
    contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
